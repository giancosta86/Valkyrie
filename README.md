# Valkyrie

*Data mining for Farbiges Deutsch*


## Introduction

**Valkyrie** is a Scala app dedicated to performing simple but interesting Data Mining on a German lexicon, producing aggregated statistics that are published on [Farbiges Deutsch](http://gianlucacosta.info/FarbigesDeutsch/) - in order to infer practical rules about German words.

A few examples of its effectiveness are:

* [German word gender by ending (sorted by relevance)](http://gianlucacosta.info/FarbigesDeutsch/gender-by-ending-and-relevance.html)

* [German plurals by ending and gender](http://gianlucacosta.info/FarbigesDeutsch/plurals.html)

It is a work-in-progress, as it's currently an [Odin](https://github.com/giancosta86/Odin)-based version of the experimental script published in [GermanStats] (https://github.com/giancosta86/GermanStats) - therefore, future refactoring and extensions are quite likely.
